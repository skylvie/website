Hi, I'm a HS junior interested in web development!
I've been interested in programming for 6~ years, since middle school.

Currently, I mostly work on fullstack projects. My main language of choice is TypeScript however I also know:
- JavaScript (of course)
- HTML & CSS (not real languages)
- Python 3 (Haven't used it in ages)
- Bash (Is this a language?)
- Java (For school and FRC)

I enjoy working on anything that involves the network really
